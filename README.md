![jpg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1309e5ac-2e1f-4fad-a89a-7dd746e2b61b)



This is a frontend application for ordering food, built using **React** and **Swiggy's live API**. It was developed as part of the "Namaste React" course by Akshay Saini, which teaches React fundamentals through hands-on projects. The app allows users to browse restaurants, search for specific options, filter by cuisine, and manage a cartâ€”all powered by real-time data from Swiggy.
